aboutme:
  title: About me
  intro: >
    I enjoy the outdoors. From hiking, mountain biking, bird watching, walking my dog, to travel. 
    Travel is a passion. I love seeing new places, experiencing new cultures, tasting new cuisine,
    and attempting to converse in other languages, although I am not fluent, or close to being,
    in any language. I enjoy playing sports especially soccer and golf. I have played on many teams
    through my life (1st Team – University Golf team, 1st Team – University Badminton team, O40’s Div. 2 Soccer Team).
    I am equally as happy playing board games with friends and family. I am an avid photographer, 
    especially when I travel, and like to read.
